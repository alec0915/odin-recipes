# odin-recipes
This is my first project from the foundations part of The Odin Project
I aim to create a webpage that lists links to different recipes 
In its current form, this will be purely made from HTML 
My goal is to get some hands-on application as a way to practice what I just learned
Specifically, creating pages properly, adding text, supplying links, using lists, and adding images
