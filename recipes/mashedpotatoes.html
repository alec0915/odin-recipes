        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Garlic mashed potatoes are the perfect side dish for many different meals. From 
            meats to stews, it's hard to go wrong with garlic mashed potatoes, and, unlike 
            regular mashed potatoes, garlic mashed potatoes are delicious without any gravy 
            (though you may still add some to further enhance the flavor if you desire.)</p>
        <p>
            This recipe takes just under half an hour to make and serves six. It's so simple
            that it only utilizes four ingredients with some additional common seasonings. 
            Cleanup should also be easy as this recipe only utilizes one large saucepan 
            along with whatever measuring vessels and utensils you use.</p>
        <p>
            You're gonna boil the potatoes and garlic, drain them, mash them, and fold in the 
            remaining ingredients. Follow the step-by-step recipe below for detailed instructions. You got this.
